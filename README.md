That image shows specifiers that we can use in the printf.  In this case, _printf just allow specifiers like
|Specifiers|Functions|Description|
|--|--|--|
|s|print_string|print a string|
|c|print_char|print just a char|
|i|print_integer|print a number in base 10|
|d|print_integer|print a number in base 10|

## Description of the main files

a) main.h : It is the one that keeps all the prototypes and the structure of the functions. Additionally, standard library header files can be included. This in order to be used by our created functions.

b) _printf : It is a function that can receive parameters that people assign to it.

c) controller : Verifies that a format handler exists within the format(%).

d) selector : Provides the format specifiers for the character string.
